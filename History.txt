Version NEXT
============
 * Fixed bug with using form data representations with authentication.
 * Added PromiscuousBasicAuthenticator to support basic authentication
   with servers that do not return challenge headers.

Version 1.0.0
============
 * Added .request() convenience method to Resourceful module.
 * Added .get(), .post(), .put(), .delete() and .head() convenience method to Resourceful module

Version 0.7.0
=============
 * Multiple values in a single header field are treated the same as repeated header fields. (Peter Williams)

Compatibility issues
--------------------

 * The semantics of the Resourceful::Header API have changed slightly.
   Previously multiple values in a single header field 
   (e.g. `Accept: application/xml, application/json`) where treated 
   differently from multiple values occurring in multiple fields (e.g 
   `Accept: application/xml\n\rAccept: application/json`).  This lead 
   to some unfortunate complexity when interacting with multi-valued 
   fields.


Version 0.6.0
=============

 * Improved support for multi-valued header fields. (Peter Williams)
 * Added convenience mechanisms for making URL encoded and multipart form data requests. (Peter Williams)
 * Ruby 1.9 support (Peter Williams)

Compatibility issues
--------------------

 * The semantics of the Resourceful::Header API have changed slightly.
   Previously, any header might return a string or an array.  Now
   fields are either "single-value" and always return a string, or
   "multi-value" and always return an array.  See API doc for more
   details.
